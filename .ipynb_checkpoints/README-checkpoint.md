Testing LLMs as a Juggling Tutor
Author: Mallika Kulkarni

I used an LLM as a tutor to someone learning tennis for the first time. I have played the sport most of my life, so I thought that it would be a great way to assess the skill of an LLM as a coach. Session #1 and #2 are as described in the assignment, 2 LLM communication chats each with their own reflection. Session #2 uses the given mollick tutor prompt. Session #3 is a communication chat after adjusting the mollick tutoring prompt.
